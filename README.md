# GT-Project1

## Description

The Inspirator: an application to help unlock creativity for persons needing a fresh approach. This site provides a different perspective to help continue or initiate a project, from writing a song to plotting a story. Whenever you need a nudge in the right direction, The Inspirator is here to help.

## User Story

When the user is trying to get ‘unstuck’, whether looking for a new design or searching for a fresh chord progression, motivational sayings from Nobel winners and photographs of breathtaking vistas may or may not do the trick. As many creative people have attested, what does help is to experience and be intrigued by another person’s work, often outside of one’s chosen field.

We are creatures hardwired to make connections: inspiration can come from anywhere. Unfortunately, given current conditions, it is not so simple or wise to visit a museum or attend a concert. Our app will make it easier to find sources of inspiration by assembling as much of the most interesting, thought-provoking, trailblazing creative content that we can in one mobile, accessible space.

We will concentrate on four main sources: Music, Visual Arts, Movies and Videos, Writing. Within each of these categories, there will be a keyword search field. This will avoid over-categorization, for the simple reason that we’d like the user to be confronted with the unexpected, the unfamiliar, the unknown, and not make it too easy to fall into familiar choices. Besides, the most creative works often transcend categorization, or create whole new ones!
